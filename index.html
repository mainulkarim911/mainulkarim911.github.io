            <h2> About Me </h2>

     

            <p>
                  <i>
            
                              My name is Mainul Karim. I am a student and I like to study. My favorite subjects are CSE and IT. My goal is to study these 
                              subjects and to become a respected professional in one of the fields.
                        
                              I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student. Moreover, being a sociable person,
                              I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting 
                              individuals. I enjoy my time at University: it is really nice to study, the students are very 
                              friendly and ready to help. The atmosphere cannot but make me want to go there every time.
                              I like to receive and deal with challenging tasks. I am a very enthusiastic student and 
                              I think this is a strong point of mine.
                        
                              My friends say that I am a very serious and an interesting boy with not a good sense of humor.
                              As soon as I meet new people who are happy to meet me, I feel extremely comfortable with them.
                              I believe that friendship is one of the most important values in human life. We exchange new
                              deas, find many interesting things about each other and experience new things. I appreciate 
                              friendship and people who surround me.
                        
                              Meeting new people who support all my efforts to grow and develop my skills not only in the subjects
                              but also in my hobbies gives me a lot of energy.  
                        
                              The goal I’m currently striving for is to make this world a better place to live in by starting
                              the changes with myself. Sure, I’ve had bad experiences in my life too, but this is exactly what
                              made me the way I am now: grateful, full of love, with a desire to study well because it will 
                              help me become a successful person in future and have a high quality of life. I believe that it
                              is manifesting day by day and I feel even more responsibility for what I do and where I go.
                              ith all I already have, I know that I’m on the right path and I will do my best to inspire
                              thers to live the way they feel like living as well.
