      <h2> <i> Future Plan and Purpose </i> </h2>

      <p> 
      
      
      <i> My purpose of  life is to become successful in this world  and hereafter. What does I mean by saying successful? 
      Because the word  successful does not define anything.  By saying successful I mean having peace in my life. Whatever 
      I achieve, if I don’t  have peace in my life, then it is useless. So in other word you can say that the my purpose of 
      life is to have  peace . But the purpose of my life is not “SMART”. Because we know that our purpose should be specific, 
      measurable, actionable, relevant, and time bound. But peace is not measurable. So what is my purpose of life? My purpose 
      of life is to establish an IT company in this country. As I always want to have an IT company of my own and I want to 
      establish it as one of the most renowned company in this world. <br><br>

      To become successful in this competitive world it is very difficult. So first we need to setup our goals according to 
      our purpose of life. <br><br>
      
      Goals : First of all I want do something for my family. Because their satisfaction is my satisfaction. So my first aim 
      is to do something for my family. Secondly to lead a successful life, first I need to have a good qualification in the 
      field where I will like to work. So my second goal is to have a good academic qualification and become the first in the 
      CSE department. And my third goal is to start an IT company in this country. <br><br>

      Objectives : At first to achieve my family satisfaction the first things that I need to do is to tell them what I am 
      going to do. To achieve my second goal the most important thing is to study regularly. And I have be punctual, organized, 
      attentive and I have to study in a constructive way. By doing so I hope I can achieve my second goal. Finally starting 
      an IT company is not a easy task. To start an IT company I need money, experts and government support. <br><br>

      Action plans : We have to be polite and respectful to our parents and then we need to tell them what we want and why. If 
      anyone speak to his/her family with wisdom and beautiful preaching and reason with them in a way that is best. And tell 
      them how much passionate you are about this. I think they will support and believe in him/her. To study effectively the 
      things I need to do are following. <br><br>

      1. Take Notes. <br>
      2. Pay Attention to Study Advice from Professors. <br>
      3. Review Notes Soon After Class. <br>
      4. Review All Notes Regularly. <br>
      5. Read Notes Out Loud. <br>
      6. Use Flash Cards. <br>
      7. Join a Study Group. <br>
      8. Teach someone else. <br>
      9. Test myself. <br>
      10. Avoid Distraction. <br>
      11. Never Give up. <br>

      <br><br>
      
      After completing my graduation I want to start my own IT company. But the most difficult part is to start. Because most of 
      the people does not how to start, when to start and what to do after start a new thing. Now here I will mention how to start,

      <br><br>

      1. Refine my idea. Build a business plan. Assess my finances. Determine my legal business structure. <br>
      2. Register with the government. <br>
      3. Purchase an insurance policy. <br>
      4. Build my team. <br>
      5. Choose my vendors. <br>
      6. Brand myself and advertise. <br>
      7. Grow my business.
